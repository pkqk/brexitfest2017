Soâ€¦ I'm leaving the country at the end of November ðŸ˜¢ and I would like to hang
out with all the lovely awesome people I've met here before I go.

<div class="questions">
  <a href="/why">Why?</a>
  <a href="/when">When?</a>
</div>

Help find a replacement for my house by sharing [my spareroom ad][room].

If there is something you think I should do before I go add it to [this bucket list][bucketlist].
