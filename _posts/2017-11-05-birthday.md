<p>To be confirmed but somewhere in Hampstead Heath</p>
<p>
  A nice sunday dinner at some nice pub up at Hampstead Heath and then letting off a bunch of fireworks
  on Parliament Hill, it will be a school night and it gets dark early in November in this country
  so that helps.

  Traditionally I've bough far too many sparklers too light all at once and some rockets.
  Other explosives are available.
