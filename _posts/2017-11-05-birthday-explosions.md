<p>Parliament Hill, Hampsted Heath</p>
<p>
  Come set some things on fire with me on Parliament Hill, while watching some
  other things get set on fire over the skyline of London.

<p>
  Traditionally I've bought far too many sparklers too light all at once and some rockets.
  Other explosives are available.
