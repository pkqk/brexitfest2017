<p>
    Hey everyone, it's been a while since I've wandered down the back streets of Bermondsey
    sampling tasty liquids.
</p>
<p>
    Join me?
</p>
<p>
    Feel free to bring others, to only come for a bit, or not even drink beer and just
    hang out.
</p>
<h4>The Plan</h4>
<p>
    Meet at the market near the Craft Coffee cart for food and most
    importantly doughnuts from St Johns and then wander along the beer
    mile.
