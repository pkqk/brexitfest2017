<p>A pub in Hampstead Heath</p>
<p>
  A nice sunday dinner at some nice pub up at Hampstead Heath and then letting
  off a bunch of fireworks on Parliament Hill, it will be a school night and it
  gets dark early in November in this country so that helps.
</p>
<p>
  I gotta book a table for this bit so tell me if you're comming, feel free to
  turn up later on a whim for a drink and then actually setting shit on fire.
