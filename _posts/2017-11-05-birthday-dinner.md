<p>The Garden Gate in Hampsted Heath at 16:00</p>
<p>
  A nice sunday dinner at some nice pub up at Hampstead Heath and then letting
  off a bunch of fireworks on Parliament Hill, it will be a school night and it
  gets dark early in November in this country so that helps.
</p>
<p>
  I booked the biggest group I could so hopefully enough of you will turn up.
