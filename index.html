          Soâ€¦ I'm leaving the country at the end of November ðŸ˜¢ and I would like to hang out with
          all the lovely awesome people I've met here before I go.
        </p>

        <h2>Events</h2>

        <h3>Market Brunch + Beer Mile</h3>
        <p><code>2017-10-07 11:30</code> starting at Maltby Street Market</p>
        <p>
          Hey everyone, it's been a while since I've wandered down the back streets of Bermondsey
          sampling tasty liquids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join me?
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to bring others, to only come for a bit, or not even drink beer and just
          hang out.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>Insert more events here</h3>
        <p>
          I'm travelling a bit in October but also have finished up at work so am available for random day
          time hanging out, seeing some art would be nice, also in case it wasn't common knowledge I like
          eating and drinking establishments.
        </p>

        <h3>Birthday</h3>
        <p><code>2017-11-05 18:00</code> in Hampstead Heath
        <p>
          A nice sunday dinner at some nice pub up at Hampstead Heath and then letting off a bunch of fireworks
          on Parliament Hill, it will be a school night and it gets dark early in November in this country
          so that helps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditionally I've bough far too many sparklers too light all at once and some rockets.
          Other explosives are available.
        </p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          Various reasons, some personal, some related to the fact that I no longer feel like
          Britain is my home.
        </p>

        <h2>What am I going to do?</h2>
        <p>Good question</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm going back to New Zealand</li>
          <li>Probably buying a station wagon and a surf board and being a bum for a bit</li>
          <li>Also home distilling is legal in NZ so <img src="booze.jpg"/></li>
        </ul>
